Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but...
    Rules: For any whole number between 1 and 100 ...
    Multiples of 3 only, or numbers containing 3, return "Fizz",
    Multiples of 5 only, or numbers containing 5, return "Buzz",
    Multiples of both, or numbers containing both, or both cases, return "FizzBuzz"
    Multiples of neither, return the given mumber, as a string

numbers that are exact multiples of 3, or that contain 3, must print a string containing "Fizz"
   For example 9 -> "...Fizz..."
   For example 31 -> "...Fizz..."

numbers that are exact multiples of 5, or that contain 5, must print a string containing "Buzz"
   For example 10 -> "...Buzz..."
   For example 52 -> "...Buzz..."
